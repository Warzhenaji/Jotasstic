## Art Management (admin/dashboard, meaning this is only for the logged in user)
- [ ] Migration for Artwork (or whatever you'll call it, update it here when you do)
 - [ ] (unsigned big integer) id
 - [ ] (string) title
 - [ ] (text) description
 - [ ] (unsigned integer) price
 - [ ] and your timestamps (created_at and updated_at)
- [ ] Model for Artwork
- [X] Page to view all existing Artwork
- [ ] Can click on Artwork from previous task to view all data about a given Artwork
- [X] Can edit Artwork (either on previous task's page or as a new page)
- [ ] Can delete Artwork (I would suggest having some notification/alert saying this is permanent delete)

## Art Purchasing
- [ ] Migration for PurchaseRequest (again, call it what you will then update it here)
 - [ ] (unsigned big integer) id
 - [ ] (string) uid, meaning unique id
 - [ ] (timestamp, nullable) payment_received_at, this is when Cierra receives payment for the order
 - [ ] (timestamp, nullable) fulfilled_at, this will denote when the Artwork was shipped out and the transaction is considered complete. You can use this to also denote whether an order is "open" or "closed"
 - [ ] (string) requester_name
 - [ ] (string) requester_email
 - [ ] (string, nullable) address_1
 - [ ] (string, nullable) address_2
 - [ ] (string, nullable) city
 - [ ] (string, nullable) state
 - [ ] (string, nullable) zip, I say to use this as a string because you don't know if she'll get a request from Canada or the US zip she gets will be 12345-9876
 - [ ] (text, nullable) notes
 - [ ] (text, nullable) internal_notes
 - [ ] and your timestamps (created_at and updated_at)
- [ ] Model for PurchaseRequest
- [ ] Page to view all PurchaseRequest
 - [ ] Default to ones with status of "open"
 - [ ] Also can view "closed" ones
- [ ] Can click on PurchaseRequest from previous task to view all data about a given PurchaseRequest
- [ ] Can edit/update a PurchaseRequest
- [ ] Can delete a PurchaseRequest, I'd be careful about doing this only for spam requests. You'll want to keep a record of every valid request you get.

## Site Design
- [ ] Make the site auto adjust to different window sizes (mimimized, maximized, mobile, etc.)
- [X] Footer with Copyright statement and symbol.
- [ ] Insert autograph image into various site locations (home button, front page logo, etc.)

## Known Issues
- [X] Error when logging in. Site does not redirect without an error.
- [ ] Cannot delete posts
- [ ] Can update post, but after update occurs, all flash notices appear at the same time on the landing page
